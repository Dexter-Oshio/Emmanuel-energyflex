## What is FlexMeasures?
FlexMeasures is an intelligent and developer-friendly EMS (energy management system) that supports real-time energy flexibility apps in a scalable and timely manner.
FlexMeasures is a real-time decision support platform (project management), but it is also a powerful simulation tool (project design).
It aids in the resolution of the following problem: 

_When are the best times to run flexible assets such as batteries, heat pumps, or industrial processes?_

FlexMeasures, in a nutshell, converts data into optimised schedules for flexible assets.

## How can we use FlexMeasures?
Here are a few examples of how FlexMeasures can assist you:
* E-mobility (smart EV charging, V2G, V2H) (smart EV charging, V2G, V2H)
* Heating (heat pump control) (heat pump control)
* Industry (best running times for processes with buffering capacity) (best running times for processes with buffering capacity)

You choose what to optimise for: prices, CO2, and peaks.

The use of FlexMeasures in integrated scenarios with increased complexity becomes even more appealing. For instance, in modern domestic/office settings in the built environment that combine solar panels, electric heating, and EV charging, in industry settings that optimise for self-consumption of local solar panels, or when consumers can engage with multiple markets at the same time.
In these cases, our goal is to assist you in achieving "value stacking," which is frequently required to achieve a positive business case.
